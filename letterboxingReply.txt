Hello, and thank you for asking the FAQ "What are these bars?".

Those bars/the border is called letterboxing. Letterboxing is a privacy technique used by Tor browser which prevents websites from using the size of your screen to identify you. Having a common screen size [is not a good defense](

Though the bars are annoying at first, they are important for preserving privacy.
