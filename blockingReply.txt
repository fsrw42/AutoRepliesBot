Hello, and thank you for asking the FAQ "Tor is blocked by a website, what can I do?".

There are some [ad-hoc solutions](https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/org/doc/ListOfServicesBlockingTor#ad-hoc-solutions-for-accessing-blocked-content-on-tor) that might work. Do note that all of these solutions should not be used if you need to login (and some do not work if you need to post a comment or otherwise send content to the website)

Another solution is to click "New Tor Circuit for this Site", see if that unblocks the website, if not click again, repeat until it works or you give up.

The best thing you can do is send the website a message asking them to reconsider blocking Tor.
