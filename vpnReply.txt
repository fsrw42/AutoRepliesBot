Hi!

I'm a bot. And I am here to tell you, that you should probably not use a VPN.

I am not going to write a gigantic (and probably incorrect, bad or something else) post on why you shouldn't since there are so many others that have already done that.

Here is a quick summary:  
If you use VPN to conceal Tor usage: If Tor isn't banned or blocked, you might not need it. Else, use bridges.

* [VPN + Tor: Not Necessarily a Net Gain](https://matt.traudt.xyz/posts/vpn-tor-not-mRikAa4h.html) By Matt Traudt (aka system33- here on reddit, great person btw.)
* [r/Tor wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/wiki/index#wiki_should_i_use_a_vpn_with_tor.3F_tor_over_vpn.2C_or_vpn_over_tor.3F)
* [Obscurix: VPNs](https://obscurix.github.io/vpns.html) (Has a section about [the TorPlusVpn on trac.torproject.org](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN), which you should read to understand whenever someone uses it as "Tor project recommends Tor+VPN")
