Hi!

I'm a bot. And I am here to tell you, that, most of the time, you dont need to use a VPN.

* [r/Tor wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/wiki/index#wiki_should_i_use_a_vpn_with_tor.3F_tor_over_vpn.2C_or_vpn_over_tor.3F)
* [Obscurix: VPNs](https://obscurix.github.io/vpns.html) (Has a section about [the TorPlusVpn on trac.torproject.org](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN), which you should read to understand whenever someone uses it as "Tor project recommends Tor+VPN")
