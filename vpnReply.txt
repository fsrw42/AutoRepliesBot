Hi!

I'm a bot. And I am here to tell you, that, most of the time, you dont need to use a VPN.

You may see some people linking to something called "trac" specifically a page called ["TorPlusVPN"](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN). They may also be saying that the page shows that the Tor developers are recommending the use of a VPN, this is not true, trac works like wikipedia, anyone can edit the pages, as stated: "Most of the content here is written by volunteers from around the world."
