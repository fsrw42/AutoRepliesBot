Hi!

I'm a bot. And I am here to tell you, that using a VPN with Tor is not a requirement, and is adviced against. [The Tor Project recommends against it](https://support.torproject.org/faq/faq-5/)

* [VPN + Tor: Not Necessarily a Net Gain](https://matt.traudt.xyz/posts/vpn-tor-not-mRikAa4h.html) By Matt Traudt (formerly at Tor Project)
* [r/Tor wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/wiki/index#wiki_should_i_use_a_vpn_with_tor.3F_tor_over_vpn.2C_or_vpn_over_tor.3F) (Mostly the same as above, just condensed) 
* [Very Precarious Narrative](https://schub.wtf/blog/2019/04/08/very-precarious-narrative.html) (Why VPNs aren't great in general)

You may see some people linking to something called "trac" specifically a page called ["TorPlusVPN"](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN). They may also be saying that the page shows that the Tor developers are recommending the use of a VPN, this is not true, trac works like wikipedia, anyone can edit the pages, as stated: "Most of the content here is written by volunteers from around the world."
